title: The keyboard in Windows, Mac and Linux
---

### What point do I want to get across in this post? ###
4.  Keyboard layout - characters like @ and ". My preference, then how to switch it up. Whatever you'll use the most is best.
5.  The fewer things you have to tweak the better...

I use OS X at home and Windows at work (and develop in Linux VMs, but that's a whole seperate thing). 
The difference that bothers me the most about switching between the two is keyboard shortcuts.

In Windows, the primary keyboard shortcut key is ctrl. 
This is ([usually][ctrlfnkey]) the in the leftmost, bottommost corner of a keyboard.
By contrast in OS X, you have the cmd key - just to the left of the space bar. Learning one or the other is not a problem, but using both every day always finds me spending a few seconds here and there puzzling why my clipboard doesn't have that thing I thought I'd copied  (or for comedic effect, bringing up a run dialogue box when I'd only wanted to refresh a page).

Help in an unlikely place
-------------------------
If you're reading this, you probably hate the Caps Lock key. 

It's big, it's taking up prime keyboard real-estate, and its functionality is annoying - both when you hit it accidentally, and when you have to watch someone use it as a Shift key.
So let's make it work for us by turning it into a giant shortcut key, one that's already under your little finger if you're on the home row. Perhaps best of all, it's in exactly the same place, no matter the OS.

Making this change on a Mac is dead easy: hit up System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys, and then remap Caps Lock to cmd.

Under Windows it's not quite so straightforward - I used [SharpKeys][sharpkeys] which modifies the registry to remap keys (also useful for remapping media keys if they're not detected by Windows *coughAppleKeyboardcough*).

I've found that this remapping becomes natural very quickly, so much so that I'll found myself trying to do it on other computers and wondering why nothing is happening.
It's also far more comfortable that using ctrl and cmd if you're bashing out shortcuts all day as caps lock is in such a more natural position - no hand contortion going on here.
