title: Gromit Unleashed in GPX format
---

If you're in Bristol then you'll have noticed a few of the Gromits that arrived on July 1st. If you have an iPhone or Android device then you should definitely [download the app][app-link] which has a map with all 80 of them.

If you have a GPS device, or prefer a GPS app, then I've created a .GPX file with the location and info for each Gromit. You can [download it here][gpx-download]. If you like it, then please consider donating to the [Wallace & Gromit Grand Appeal][grand-appeal-donate].

For those who are interested, the iPhone app bundle contains a JSON file which holds data about each Gromit. I wrote a quick Perl script to extract this data and output it in GPX form. You can grab this script from GitHub (link coming soon).
